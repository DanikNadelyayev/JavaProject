IOT_Coursework

OIL_RIG 

1. Draw a diagram of the classes that will be used to complete the course work and indicate the relationships between them

2. Write appropriate classes, use the lombok library to reduce the amount of code

2. Implement REST services for all entities using Spring Boot. It is necessary to implement operations: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE operation GET / 2 - returns the entity with id equal to 2. Operation / GET - returns all entities that are present in the system

3. Divide the code into controllers, services and data access level

4. Linking controllers, services, and data access levels should be done using dependency inversion

5. Implement data storage and proofreading them from the csv-file. Important: Each entity is stored in a separate file.

6. If the file does not exist for the entity - it should be created, the file name should contain the date of creation, for example: Ñ† fish-2022-05-27.csv

7. Each file should contain headers (matching the names of the attributes of the designed classes) only in the first line.

8. When you start the application, all entities are read from the file and saved in the hash map. When reading data, you should search for all files for the entity that were created in the current month (for example, all files created in June if the program starts in June)

9. The course work code must be available as an OL on github

10. The project must contain README.md with a description of the task and step-by-step instructions for starting the program

11. The project must use maven to build the project

12. The code should be checked using Spotbugs and checkstyle

13. The code must contain unit tests to check the logic of writing and finding files on the file system

14. Create a set (collection) of REST queries that test the performance of developed services
